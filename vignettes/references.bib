	shorttitle = {Impact of storms on rail transport},
	abstract = {Storms (thunderstorms or windstorms) are common meteorological phenomena in Europe. They produce rain, lightning, strong winds or hail and are capable of causing serious failures in rail transport. We identified 14,786 incidents associated with storms, which took place on the Czech rail network between 2002 and 2021. This represented 5\% of all reported rail incidents in Czechia over the monitored period. Using the exact binomial test and a grid covering each combination of month and hour, we found that these incidents were concentrated between May and August in the early morning and afternoon hours. Most of the rail problems were concentrated on only a small number of days, indicating the significant impact of severe storms. The incidents (82\%) were associated with rail device failures and/or power outages, such as malfunctions of switches, signals or communication and safety devices. In addition, tree falls on rail infrastructure were also common. The total train delay time exceeded 3917 h, and in some cases rail traffic was even completely disrupted. Based on the findings, which provide unique insight into the impacts of storms on railways, mitigation measures are discussed. This is particularly important given climate change, which may lead to an increased likelihood of severe weather and associated damage in the future.},
